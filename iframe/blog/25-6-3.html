    <div class="header"><h1>Concert?</h1> <small>June 3, 2025</small></div>
        <p>I went to the first concert I've gone to yesterday. My _smart friend introduced me to the artist a few months ago and invited me to this 
		production. She's a amazing artist, and I'm quite pleased that my _smart friend introduced me to her. I wasn't sure what to expect from the concert, and I was pleasantly suprised. 
		<p>The concert was a standing concert. We got there at 7pm even though the concert started at 8, which proved to be a very good thing. 
		My _smart friend was able to get us a third-row position (we had to ask the guys in front of us if we could go ahead because they were comparatively tall). 
		There were two parties that played in the concert: 
		a singular guy and the main band we were here for (the artist is also a band and the band is also the artist. it's hard to describe). The singular guy was really good and helped warm up the audience to the louder band, I think. 
		He did a duet with the artist. There was a couple in front of us who were kind of tall and helped take me and my _smart friend's picture. They were friendly and called us "cute." ("0_o)? After the opening artist ended, the couple left, and we were unsure if they would come back, so we kept holding their spot for them. 
		They never came back... dun dun DUN.<p>
		<p>The part with the main band was very good though. The lighting and orchestral instruments made the whole thing very cinematic, and the main singer 
		is very talented. We were bobbing our heads most of the time. Everyone was friendly and congenial to each other; there was a guy behind us (he was one of the guys who were initially in front of us, but let us go ahead) who was very social and
		talked to quite a few people, including a child. They had a nice conversation too- it felt natural and not forced, where they bonded over the artist's songs. </p>
		<p>The child and her mom went in front of us for one song; the kid's favorite song, which was good, 'cause, you know... kids are short. 
		It was a bit weird, though, because the kid's mom was very drunk. She danced the whole time as she held a beer can. She turned around to talk to us 
		and was a little <i>too</i> friendly and touched our arms. We quickly shut her down and she turned back around. After the song was over, she and her 
		child left from in front of us.</p>
		<p>We left at 10:30, which was as soon as the artist declared that the production was over, even though the audience still 
		demanded an encore. We chose a good time to leave though- the merchandise line was short and we could still hear the 
		encore song in the background, and we were both tired since it had been a couple of hours. (Apparently my _smart friend could tell when I got tired... it's kind of funny to think that there might
		be a huge, immediate face change when I'm tired versus when I'm not tired. I wonder how long it takes- 15 minutes? 30 Seconds? This statement is too long and should be a footnote.) </p>

		<p>My _smart friend bought me a very pretty t-shirt. Yes, she also bought the tickets... I gotta 
		figure out how to pay her back for her relentless hospitality.</p>
		<p>Overall, 10/10 experience, would recommend, 5 stars, etc. That's all I have to leave you with, I guess. This is my first journal entry here, 
		so in the future, I might make regular segments that I can add every time to keep some semblance of structure and continuity.</p>
		<p>I'll put a quirky sign-off here later.</p>
		<p>*At the time of writing, _smart friend is a very funny inside joke to me and my _smart friend. So yes, "_smart friend" is intentional.</p>
