				<p style="margin: 10px;">I started crocheting in 2021. I've been increasingly more casual in my crochet, taking
				crochet more as a relaxing thing to do rather than trying to work on larger projects like my blankets. I only started taking photos of my projects in 2024.
				Here are some of the projects I've done since. All crochet photos were taken by me; please do not repost or reshare any of these project photos.</p>
