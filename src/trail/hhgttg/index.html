                    <p>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy started with a BBC radio series, and since has gotten two movie adaptions and a book series.
                    It is a story, but also a fictional encyclopedia about... well... the universe. I've love it since since 2021. Or 2022. Something like that. 
                    </p>
					<p>I watched the 2005 movie first, and was charmed by the dry humor. For instance, in the beginning of the movie, Arthur (the main character) 
                    loses his home to people who were building a highway, only for Earth to be demolished for the same reason. Or, that when the crew is being chased after missiles, which was  
                    a black box situation<a class="footnote">&sup1<span>A while ago, I thought I had found a Wikipedia page saying that "black box" is a genuine literary device. 
                    I can't find that page now, so maybe I'm making up literary devices.</span></a>.
                    The deus ex machina is that the missles turn into a bowl of petunias and a whale.</p>
                    <p>
                    The HHGTTG fandom has also made an encyclopedia of their own, called <a src="h2g2.com/">h2g2.com</a>. The encyclopedia HHGTTG canonically only has a 
                    single sentance - well, not even a sentance, more like a sentance fragment - about Earth: "Mostly harmless." This online HHGTTG encyclopedia could be seen
                    as a way of the fandom trying to compensate for the lacklust entry. h2g2 originated on BBC and is now not really connected.
                    My favorite page is <a src="https://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A11485019">Bizarre Beetle Branding</a>, a page that connects three of my loves: HHGTTG, entomology,
                    and the etymology of entomology. It's quite funny. You should check it out.
                    </p>
                    <p>Right now this page just has a bunch of text, and I want to add more, so eventually I am probably going to consider breaking up this page into 
                    divisions to measure out content so as not to overwhelm the user.</p>
